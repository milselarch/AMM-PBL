# AMM-PBL

Adapted from [Javascript for Physics animations](https://github.com/devramtal/Physics-for-JavaScript-Games-Animation-Simulations). Chapter 10: orbits.js, index.html and dependenct files.

Orbital simulation in javascript and HTML. Used for cheaking that equations derived and asssumptions used for a report we had to write for an advanced maths report. Changes made include using a fixed delta time between each physics calculation update and making that keep up to actual time passed, displaying orbit velocities as a top bar, adding 'trails' to orbiting objects to visually discern path taken and adding a couple constants to adjust animation speed relative to time passed.
